			<h1>1 Thessalonians 4:13-15</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<sup>13 </sup>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 
				<sup>14 </sup>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
				<sup>15 </sup>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
