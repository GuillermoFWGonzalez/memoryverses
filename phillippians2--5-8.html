			<h1>Phillippians 2:5-8</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>&emsp;
				<sup>5 </sup>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
				<sup>6 </sup>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 
				<sup>7 </sup>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
				<sup>8 </sup>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
