			<h1>Isaiah 53:4-6</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<sup>1 </sup>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 
				<sup>2 </sup>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 
				<sup>3 </sup>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
