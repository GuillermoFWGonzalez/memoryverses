			<h1>Proverbs 15:5-10</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>&emsp;
				<sup>5 </sup>A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. 
				<sup>6 </sup>In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 
				<sup>7 </sup>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. 
				<sup>8 </sup>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 
				<sup>9 </sup>The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. 
				<sup>10 </sup>Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.
