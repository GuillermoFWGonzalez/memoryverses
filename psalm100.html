			<h1>Psalm 100</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>&emsp;
				<sup>1</sup> Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.
				<sup>2</sup> Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
				<sup>3</sup> Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
				<sup>4</sup> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
				<sup>5</sup> For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
