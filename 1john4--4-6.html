			<h1>1 John 4:4-6</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<sup>4 </sup>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
				<sup>5 </sup>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 
				<sup>6 </sup>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
