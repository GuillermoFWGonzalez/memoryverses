			<h1>1 John 4:1-3</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<sup>1 </sup>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
				<sup>2 </sup>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
				<sup>3 </sup>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
