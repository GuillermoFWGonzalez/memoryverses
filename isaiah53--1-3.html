			<h1>Isaiah 53:1-3</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<sup>1 </sup>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? 
				<sup>2 </sup>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. 
				<sup>3 </sup>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
